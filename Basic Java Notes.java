# Basic Java Notes

## Basic Syntax

* Variables must be declared before use
* Java is statically typed, meaning that the type of a variable is determined at compile time
* Variables can be reassigned
* The `final` keyword can be used to make a variable immutable

## Data Types

### Primitive Types

* `boolean`: a boolean value (true or false)
* `char`: a single character (e.g. 'a')
* `byte`: an 8-bit signed integer (e.g. -128 to 127)
* `short`: a 16-bit signed integer (e.g. -32768 to 32767)
* `int`: a 32-bit signed integer (e.g. -2147483648 to 2147483647)
* `long`: a 64-bit signed integer (e.g. -9223372036854775808 to 9223372036854775807)
* `float`: a 32-bit floating point number (e.g. 3.14f)
* `double`: a 64-bit floating point number (e.g. 3.14)

### Non-Primitive Types

* `String`: a sequence of characters (e.g. "hello")
* `Array`: a collection of elements of the same type (e.g. int[] arr = {1, 2, 3})
* `List`: an ordered collection of elements (e.g. List<String> list = new ArrayList<>())
* `Map`: a collection of key-value pairs (e.g. Map<String, Integer> map = new HashMap<>())

### Operations

#### Arithmetic Operations

* `+` (addition)
* `-` (subtraction)
* `*` (multiplication)
* `/` (division)
* `%` (modulus)
* `++` (increment)
* `--` (decrement)

#### Relational Operations

* `==` (equality)
* `!=` (inequality)
* `>` (greater than)
* `<` (less than)
* `>=` (greater than or equal to)
* `<=` (less than or equal to)

#### Logical Operations

* `&&` (logical and)
* `||` (logical or)
* `!` (logical not)

#### Assignment Operations

* `=` (assignment)
* `+=` (addition assignment)
* `-=` (subtraction assignment)
* `*=` (multiplication assignment)
* `/=` (division assignment)
* `%=` (modulus assignment)
* `<<=` (left shift assignment)
* `>>=` (right shift assignment)
* `&=` (bitwise and assignment)
* `^=` (bitwise xor assignment)
* `|=` (bitwise or assignment)
